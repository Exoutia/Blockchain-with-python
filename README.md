# Blockchain-with-python

This is a personal project to code a functional blockchain with a cryptocurrency and to better understand inner working of this technology 
that if utilised correctly can change the world for good.

I have used:
    Flask(Python Library)
    Postman(Application)
### 11-05-2022
Today I done a demo by creating 3 files with code crypto code in base folder with deifferent port at the end of code and send different post and get request to simulate a crypto transaction, mining of block and maintaining the chain across node in different places or codes.
This is just a simple simulation it needs improvement like automation and across whole different node to sync them everytime.
